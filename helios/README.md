# Helios Visulation Tools

This part of the MAP repo contains tools that work with
Sparta-developed models to visualize the data generated.

1. Plato -- (WIP) A web-based visualization tool that will consume
   database files generated by Sparta-based models and allow the user
   to "drag-n-drop" plots onto a main canvas

//2. Note that prior Sparta releases had the Argos tool here
//   in Helios (pipeline visualization). That has been moved
//   to an external git repo which Sparta uses as a submodule.
//   See the README file here: map/sparta/simdb/README.md
